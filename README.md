# Amber and GoVM

### Amber

**Amber** is a programming language that i am trying to create for educational purpose.

### GoVM

**GoVM** is the VM that interprets the "Assembly" produced by the compiler, it's fully written in Golang.

### Installation

In the terminal, type the following commands : 
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Bartbulteau/govm.git
cd govm
./setup.sh
```

If you want to, you can start by compiling the test.amb file with :
```bash
amber test.amb exe
```

To run the exe file, use :
```bash
./exe
```
or
```bash
govm exe
```
